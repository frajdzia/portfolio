                                        cultural and creative interest, and cultural heritage. I got
                                        to know different methods for engaging and
                                        mobilizing fellow citizens and how to communicate
                                        to cultural providers.

                                        of creative methods and learn new practical

                                        exchange I have been sharing modern
                                        socio-cultural issues. I have talked with others about problems
                                        young people face every day and made
                                        recipients aware of what it means to be young nowadays.
                                        To conclude the project, all participants have created
                                        photography exhibition that have showed
                                        these highlighted issues.
